 &nbsp; having my birthday so close to new year's is wildly inconvenient because how am i supposed to upstage 2024? 
<br> &nbsp; but also fetus kq was onto something. january 2nd does the least damage. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; if my birthday is on new year's day then game over: "new year's day and kq's birthday!" everyone goes who's kq? no one gaf. 
<br> &nbsp; if my birthday is on december 31st then also game over: everyone's tired. worn out from the old year. in this case it would also be me versus the ball drop. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; it also helps that i was born at 5:43 am on the 2nd of the 1st month. 
<br> &nbsp; i haven't yet met anyone with matchy matchy birth days and times. oh you were born on 5-5-2005? what time was it? 5:55? it wasn't? yeah i thought so. 
<br> &nbsp; though if that actually is your birthday and birth time that is really something.
