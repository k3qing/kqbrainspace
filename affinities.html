	&nbsp; <i> Brian Dillon describes, in his book "Affinities," that when he writes the word "affinity" in critical prose, <br>
		&nbsp; it seems like he is trying to point elsewhere, to something "unthought," or perhaps "unkillable," <br>
		&nbsp;	by attitudes or arguments. To him, affinity appears in the way multiple objects, collected by artists <br>
		&nbsp; and sometimes himself, appear to seduce and brush up against one another. </i> <br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;		I feel that Dillon's affinity, when imbued with the sense of the inarticulate, starts <br>
	&nbsp;		to hit against the word "disposition"--which is to say, we don't know why we have favorite <br>
		&nbsp;	colors, just that we have them. We are smiley babies or sadder ones by no other force,<br>
		&nbsp;	it seems, than nature. We do have at our disposal the words to explain what we like about <br>
		&nbsp;	the color, and that particular shade, but who's to say that's why we like it? The process of <br> 
		&nbsp; 	picking a favorite still looks a lot like dropping a color picker into a gradient and stopping <br>
		&nbsp;	when you feel like it. Shift it here and there--after a point, it no longer becomes your favorite. <br>
		&nbsp;	The affinity ends. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;	The difficulty in criticizing a fantastic movie or book, then, is that it is an act of dissection. <br> 
		&nbsp;	From the warm fuzz of affinity comes a reason you have to reluctantly draw out. It's the examination of <br>
		&nbsp;	a first impulse that almost wants to be left untouched. There's a comfort in liking something and not having <br> 
		&nbsp;	to explain why, and as a result the interest becomes an extension of the self. The freckles on someone's nose <br> 
		&nbsp;	just are. Affinities run so deep that their relationship to the one harboring the affinity is unquestionable; <br>  
		&nbsp;	to Dillon, unkillable. I don't quite have an affinity with this bit of writing yet, but I suspect if I revised <br>
		&nbsp;  it I would begin to feel a connection to it that I couldn't articulate. Once I felt the click of good writing <br>
		&nbsp;  inside me, I would step away and deem it perfect enough. <br> <br> 

		&nbsp; 	I will grow up, become a better writer, look at this page again, and believe my affinity to it has faded. <br> 
		&nbsp;	I will change, and the affinity will too. Again and again I strive to be fleetingly perfect. <br> 
		&nbsp;	Whatever comes close I see as kin.
