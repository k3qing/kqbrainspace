&nbsp; it's fitting that i have the odyssey in my backpack on this greyhound trip. on the way, i asked the man sitting next to me 
<br> &nbsp; how he reclined his seat and about thirty minutes later discovered he writes reports for the UN and is a polyglot. he gave me 
<br> &nbsp; his business card and some three dollars in CFA francs (west african currency). the bus took a couple stops at plattsburg and 
<br> &nbsp; albany, where i bought some haribo gummies. ate them and tried to sleep. ended up with this greyhound thought (1). i then managed 
<br> &nbsp; to nap and arrived on time at port authority. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; after saying goodbye to my UN friend alix, i was haggled by a taxi driver and took a brief stop at a mcdonald's to situate myself. 
<br> &nbsp; found my way to EuroPan Cafe, open 24 hours, and ordered a mocha to keep me awake. while i was standing at the counter, a man in a 
<br> &nbsp; flannel came in and asked for some cash, then stuck his hand into the tip jar and left. the workers came out yelling. i sat down in 
<br> &nbsp; the back with my mocha and cracked my computer to entertain me through the night. i've spent about an hour here so far and don't have 
<br> &nbsp; the heart to tell the workers that i'll be here another three. i'll wait until they ask me how long i'm staying. there was a young woman 
<br> &nbsp; in here who was either really high or really tired, then a short white guy who asked the workers whether they've ever been to hong kong 
<br> &nbsp; and that this place reminded him of some cafe in hong kong, then a taller white guy with a coffee in the back. there were a couple 
<br> &nbsp; ambulances stationed outside when i arrived, and they're gone now. i'm typing to keep myself awake; the coffee is good but not helping
<br> &nbsp; much. leo made me another layover jamz and i'll listen in a bit if my phone doesn't drop to thirty or forty percent. 
	<br>
<br> &nbsp; my favorite customers arrived. there's a sweet gay couple the next table over who paid for a homeless man's breakfast. he kept haggling 
<br> &nbsp; them for cash after eating their $13 worth of food-- he asked for a red velvet cupcake, then a cheesecake, then some coffee. one of the 
<br> &nbsp; guys in the couple gave me a little smile and wave when he left. poor guy came in for a $7 meal and came out down $25 (he gave another 
<br> &nbsp; five dollars to another man). i wish i had something to give them. i would have given them my sun catchers but they were a gift. red 
<br> &nbsp; velvet man tossed the coffee cup on the ground as he left and it made me quite upset. i am pretty sleepy and a little delirious but 
<br> &nbsp; still have a couple hours to wait out the layover. pretty optimistic now that there's only about 2.5 hours to go. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; (1) greyhound thoughts while in want of sleep: 
<br> &nbsp; wanting to be a tree when dying; wanting to return to the earth. i would research exactly how they make those human ash seed pods but 
<br> &nbsp; i'm trying to conserve battery and cellular data; a couple hundred megabytes were wasted on looking at some rotten tomatoes reviews of 
<br> &nbsp; Saltburn already. it always surprises me when people choose to be a tree when dying; to assume another form of life. in this way, they 
<br> &nbsp; wish for reincarnation. but i doubt the process of becoming a tree is as simple as that: i doubt people are compatible with germination. 
<br> &nbsp; they're at most what the tree grows in or around. i wonder if as many people would want to "become a tree" if they knew they had no effect
<br> &nbsp; or were maybe even detrimental to its growth.  
<br>
<br> &nbsp; after returning to port authority and sharing the ground with a service pitbull named buster for a while, i found my way to grand central 
<br> &nbsp; station and took the train down. i was running on a bag of chips, some poutine, and haribo gummies from last evening. i thought about the 
<br> &nbsp; people back at port authority, who had to wait another three hours for the bus, and felt better. the train then nearly broke down and 
<br> &nbsp; returned to the station, and i swapped tracks. i showed my digital ticket to the conductor and took a nap until we hit New Haven.  
<br>
<br> &nbsp; i wish there were a prettier message to my journey that i could ascribe to it, but having a takeaway from Greyhound trips dulls or even 
<br> &nbsp; denies their purely absurd experience. despite all the inconvenience it was worth $120.
