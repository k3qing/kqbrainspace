<br> &nbsp; it's fitting that i have the odyssey in my backpack on this greyhound trip. on the way, i asked the man sitting next to me how he reclined his seat and about thirty minutes later discovered he writes reports for the UN and is a polyglot. he gave me his business card and some three dollars in CFA francs (west african currency). the bus took a couple stops at plattsburg and albany, where i bought some haribo gummies. ate them and tried to sleep. ended up with several thoughts i can only call greyhound musings (1). i then managed to nap and arrived on time at port authority. 

after saying goodbye to my UN friend alix, i was haggled by a taxi driver and took a brief stop at a mcdonald's to situate myself. found my way to EuroPan Cafe, open 24 hours, and ordered a mocha to keep me awake. while i was standing at the counter, a man in a flannel came in and asked for some cash, then stuck his hand into the tip jar and left. the workers came out yelling. i sat down in the back with my mocha and cracked my computer to entertain me through the night. i've spent about an hour here so far and don't have the heart to tell the workers that i'll be here another three. i'll wait until they ask me how long i'm staying. there was a young woman in here who was either really high or really tired, then a short white guy who asked the workers whether they've ever been to hong kong and that this place reminded him of some cafe in hong kong, then a taller white guy with a coffee in the back. there were a couple ambulances stationed outside when i arrived, and they're gone now. i'm typing to keep myself awake; the coffee is good but not helping much. leo made me another layover jamz and i'll listen in a bit if my phone doesn't drop to thirty or forty percent. 

my favorite customers arrived. there's a sweet gay couple the next table over who paid for a homeless man's breakfast. he kept haggling them for cash after eating their $13 worth of food-- he asked for a red velvet cupcake, then a cheesecake, then some coffee. one of the guys in the couple gave me a little smile and wave when he left. poor guy came in for a $7 meal and came out down $25 (he gave another five dollars to another man). i wish i had something to give them. i would have given them my sun catchers but they were a gift. red velvet man tossed the coffee cup on the ground as he left and it made me quite upset. i am pretty sleepy and a little delirious but still have a couple hours to wait out the layover. pretty optimistic now that there's only about 2.5 hours to go. 

(1) greyhound musings while in want of sleep: 

wanting to be a tree when dying; wanting to return to the earth. i would research exactly how they make those human ash seed pods but i'm trying to conserve battery and cellular data; a couple hundred megabytes were wasted on looking at some rotten tomatoes reviews of Saltburn already. it always surprises me when people choose to be a tree when dying; to assume another form of life. in this way, they wish for reincarnation. but i doubt the process of becoming a tree is as simple as that: i doubt people are compatible with germination. they're at most what the tree grows in or around. i wonder if as many people would want to "become a tree" if they knew they were harmless or maybe even detrimental to its growth.  

after returning to port authority and sharing the ground with a service pitbull named buster for a while, i found my way to grand central station and took the train down. i was running on a bag of chips, some poutine, and haribo gummies from last evening. i thought about the people back at port authority, who had to wait another three hours for the bus, and felt better. the train then nearly broke down and returned to the station, and i swapped tracks. i showed my digital ticket to the conductor and took a nap until we hit New Haven.  

i wish there were a prettier message to my journey that i could ascribe to it, but having a takeaway from Greyhound trips dulls or even denies their purely absurd experience. despite all the inconvenience it was worth $120.
