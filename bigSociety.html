	&nbsp; Lately there's been no shortage of Yalies/friends/family ascribing little woes to a big clunky word: society. 
<br> &nbsp; I'm not going to go around hounding on everyone who does, because this is the one go-to for folks who are culturally active, 
<br> &nbsp; and I can't fault people for recognizing that capital-S Society is a good word for addressing, simply, the state of things. 
<br> &nbsp; The state of the world as it seems to that particular individual--the word 'society' is satisfying in that it is both ubiquitous 
<br> &nbsp; and versatile. But blaming the state of things is really a distracting tactic; it leads one's eye away from scrutinizing oneself. 
<br> &nbsp; Say I've made a pink bracelet for my guy friend and he refuses to wear it. The instinct is to blame the factors that contributed 
<br> &nbsp; to his fragile masculinity; blame the childhood messaging through baby showers and gendered toys that ascribed pink to girls and 
<br> &nbsp; blue to guys. It's true that these affect the image a man prescribes to himself. But the logic in blaming the order of things leaves 
<br> &nbsp; no room for individual improvement, to myself and to my friend. As it is, if I find my friend's actions offensive, I must tell him 
<br> &nbsp; straight: no productive work is done by complaining, by punching at the bag of Society that hangs above all of us. There is no one 
<br> &nbsp; who hasn't been affected by social constructs, but simultaneously, no one who hasn't been affected in some manner by the individuals 
<br> &nbsp; that they surround themselves with. We have the ability to gently interrogate ourselves, our friends, and our enemies; to look closely 
<br> &nbsp; at our own biases and wonder where they may have come from.
